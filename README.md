# ETL_Project

Our project will involve the contents of two databases: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/disney-plus-shows
- https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+ratings.csv

The first database lists movies available on the streaming site Disney+, and the second lists movies with their IMDB ratings. The proper information will be extracted and transformed in Jupyter Notebook, and then loaded into an SQL database for merging.
